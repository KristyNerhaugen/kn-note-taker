# Challenge Eleven: KN Note Taker ![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
### For this challenge, I added the back end functionality to the supplied started code to create a note taking application. Users can enter a title and text information for a note and then click the save icon to save the notes. They notes information persists on the website. Users can view a note from the list by clicking on it. They can also delete a note by clicking the delete icon. Here is the link to the application, which is deployed using Heroku: [Note Taker](https://kn-note-taker.herokuapp.com/). To access the code, you can find the GitHub repository here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KristyNerhaugen/kn-note-taker/tree/main).

## Credits 
### Starter code was provided to me for this application. The starter code can be found here: [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka). I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this scheduler. I especially used what I learned in Module 11 and code that was given through Module 11 as a guide for this challenge. While working on getting the notes to delete, I used Module 12 as a guide at times and also used http://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.delete.method.
